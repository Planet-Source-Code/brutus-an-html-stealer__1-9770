				HTML STEALER VERSION 1.0
				------------------------
_.*'`'*.__.*'`'*.__.*'`'*.__.*'`'*.__.*'`'*.__.*'`'*.__.*'`'*.__.*'`'*.__.*'`'*._

This is an important README that you should read before 	*
you use this application.					  *
								     *
HTML STEALER is NOT technically stealing code from webpages,		*
it is merely downloading code from the page you requested. 		   *
This has its advantages as it is a lot quicker and easier to		      *
get desired code this way than by actually going to the page.			*
										 *
As well as stealing code, it also allows you to edit that code,			  *
or create your own and save as an HTML file. Another feature is it 		  *
allows you to code your own Windows programs in Visual Basic, for		  *
example and run them through a visual basic interpreter to compile 		  *
them. NOTE: this program doesn't compile the Visual Basic, it merely 		  *
provides a platform for you to write the code. Therefore, it doesnt 		  *
contain any debugging tools either.						  *
										  *
If you have any problems then look at the Help section in the program 		  *
itself, or contact me at axeboy15@hotmail.com. You may also post critisisms	  *
to this address, as long as they are constructive.				  *
										  *
	TERMS AND CONDITIONS							  *
	--------------------							    *
You may use this program whenever you want. It is not illegal to use it, and you may  *
copy it if you wish and use on other computers in your household. However, if you wish  *
to use any of the code, please contact me, or at least leave credit for my work.          *
					THANK YOU!					  *
